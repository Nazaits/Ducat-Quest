# Ducat Quest

> *This is my million-dollar, vibe-coded, AI-powered, gamified to-do app.* <br>
> Got tasks to do? Got a Temu addiction? Welcome to the solution you never knew you needed. <br>
> Now you can actually **get things done** *and* shamelessly treat yourself—without the guilt spiral (well, maybe a little). <br>

## Why Ducat Quest?

* Every task you add gets magically (and sometimes unfairly) assigned a value in **ducats**—our patented fake currency (not actually patented, but it feels important).
* Don’t know how much a task should be worth? **That’s the neat part: you don’t!** Our Large Language Model overlord does all the thinking for you.
* The harder the task, the bigger the reward.
  (Or maybe not. Sometimes the AI is a little troll. That’s life.)
* Earn ducats, exchange them for real-life prizes from your very own shop.
  No more buyer’s remorse—just a never-ending loop of productivity and questionable spending decisions.

*P.S. This entire text was also “vibe coded.” Results may vary. Consult your local LLM for best practices.*

## Installation

### **Option 1: pip**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Option 2: uv (the cool way)**

First, install `uv` (if you don’t have it):

```bash
pip install uv
```

Then install your dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

---

## Quick Start

**1. (If you haven’t installed dependencies, see above.)**

---

### **To Run the App**

**Using plain old Python:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**Or, if you’re living in the fast lane with uv:**

```bash
uv pip run streamlit run app.py
```

*(Why use `uv pip run`? It runs things with exactly your locked environment—no more, no less. Maximum vibes, minimal drama.)*

**Or, just tun the "Ducat Quest.cmd" (this assumes you have uv set up)**

---

* The app will launch in your browser.
* Don’t forget to set up your Gemini/Google API key in your `.env` file.
* Start adding tasks, dreaming up questionable rewards, and conquering your productivity one ducat at a time.

## Features

* **Ducat-Powered Motivation:**
  Every task you add is assigned a magical (and sometimes infuriating) ducat value by a Large Language Model that understands both ambition and pain.
* **AI Judges All:**
  No more self-sabotage or analysis paralysis—just let the AI decide how much that laundry is *really* worth.
* **Progress Reports & Partial Grading:**
  Didn’t quite finish a task? Write a daily report and let the AI grade your honesty—get full, partial, or “nice try” ducats based on what you actually did.
  (*Yes, you get credit for effort. Yes, it’s that smart.*)
* **Shop of Wonders:**
  Add any real-life reward (from a LEGO minifig to a new car) to your shop. Redeem your hard-earned ducats for a prize you probably didn’t need, but definitely deserved.
* **Gamified Rotation:**
  Shop rewards rotate weekly—sometimes you win, sometimes you weep. Instantly add “must-have” rewards to the rotation (with a ducat tax!) if you can’t wait for fate.
* **Budget Controls:**
  Set (and even top-up) your monthly budget, adjust the conversion rate, and watch your economy rise and fall like crypto—minus the SEC.
* **Inflation-Proofing:**
  Built-in inflation protection. The AI sees your whole shop and budget, so rewards don’t become Monopoly money.
* **Completed Task History:**
  Relive your glory! View a full, expandable list of completed tasks, including when you did them and how many ducats you scored.
* **Totally Vibe-Coded:**
  The code is messy, the features are genius, and the experience is unlike anything on the App Store.
